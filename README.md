# create-shortcut-linux
application that generates a .desktop file for creating a shortcut in linux


Application to facilitate the creation of the .desktop file

the .desktop file is used to create shortcuts in the linux OS menu

sometimes I need to create a shortcut to a script or application
an example is eclipse
your installation does not create shortcut in the menu

you enter the app name, app path, icon path, and comment.
and then click Generate and Download the file and move this file to this path:

/ usr / share / applications /
